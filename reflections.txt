This has been a challenging course so far but well organised. I particularly like the regular communication from tutors and I have a clear idea of what I want to achieve.
The reason that I took this course was to learn how to write Javascript and also develop the knowledge to
be able to build my own interactive CV so that I can attract prospective employers. I am keen to keep going until I get the work life balance and
job satisfaction that I believe I can achieve from web development.

The most difficult skills so far with this course have been developing the self reliance to be able to research topics and answer small
problems on my own. I have had guidance from the udacity course notes but it is clear that the tasks are gradually becoming more
challenging and there is a greater need for determination and self reliance in developing particular web strategies.

The easiest part of the course has been watching the videos and following the explanations for basic HTML. On the other hand it has been
more challenging to put this into practice within a project setting.

I have taken careful note of the advice in the videos regarding looking at MDN pages to research HTML and Javascript and I have
been quite impressed by the documentation which is quite extensive.
